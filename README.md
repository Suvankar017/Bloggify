# Welcome to Bloggify
Hi! I'm nothing. And I'm also not sure why I'm wasting my time on writting these **Readme File**. But here is the story....

On some day of these year, *i.e* **2021**, a badboy notice came from our college, that we have to make a project on something by working togather as a group (*of 6-7 students*).

As I'm a brilliant programmer **[Speed-Note : And by brilliant I mean a good copy-paster code from forums]**, I'm getting many phone calls to join their group. So, as every other guys, I have joined a group where no-one actually need me :slightly_smiling_face:. But the point is they are very much ***brilliant***, not as dumb as me.

And after working for several days of our life **[Speed-Note : And by working I mean eating :meat_on_bone: and sleeping :sleeping:]**, we have finally done the project, which can barely stand-up on it toes *(if the project has one)*.

So, Thank you to all of my imaginary non-funny audience for holding your breath to the exciting (dumb) website launching fanda. And here we gooo...
